# R/Rstudio workshops

These are notes and lesson plans for R/RStudio workshops that I have run. 

* ResBaz - these are based off [Nikki Rubinstein's](https://twitter.com/nikkirubinstein) workshop guide which can be found [here](https://nikkirubinstein.gitbooks.io/resguides-introductory-r-workshop/content/content/01-rstudio-intro.html).
  + IntroDay1 and IntroDay2 are lesson plans for the parts of the 2-day introduction to R workshop workshop I taught. 
  + Tidy1dayIntro contains lesson plans for a 1-day introduction to R workshop. 
  + ResPitch is a short 30min introduction (taster) to R I gave at the 2017 Melbourne Research Bazaar conference.
* Peter Mac - these are based off the Cambridge [Data Manipulation and Visualisation using R](http://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/r-intermediate/) materials. The lesson materials were adapted so it could be taught in one half day.
* WEHIDay4 - these are based off the Introduction to R workshops [Brendan Ansell](https://github.com/bansell) designed. The entire course was taught over 4 x half days and I taught the last workshop.
