# R/Rstudio workshops

These are notes and lesson plans for R/RStudio workshops that I have run. 

* ResBaz - lesson plans from when I worked as the R/RStudio community coordinator at [Research Bazaar](http://melbourne.resbaz.edu.au/). 
  + IntroDay1 and IntroDay2 are lesson plans for the 2-day introduction to R workshop workshop I taught. Note that I did not teach the afternoon session of day 2. The workshop is based off [Nikki Rubinstein's](https://twitter.com/nikkirubinstein) guide which can be found [here](https://nikkirubinstein.gitbooks.io/resguides-introductory-r-workshop/content/content/01-rstudio-intro.html).
  + Tidy1dayIntro contains lesson plans for a 1-day introduction to R workshop. 
  + [OpenRes](https://resbaz.github.io/OpenRes/) was a 'guided hackathon' event ran by Research Bazaar. The notes were for a short workshop I ran during the event.
  + ResPitch is a short 30min introduction (taster) to R I gave at the 2017 Melbourne Research Bazaar conference.
* Peter Mac - these are for the Introduction to R workshops ran at the [Peter MacCallum Cancer Center](https://www.petermac.org/). The course runs over 4 half days and I taught dplyr and ggplot2 on one of the days. The content is based off the Cambridge [Data Manipulation and Visualisation using R](http://bioinformatics-core-shared-training.github.io/r-intermediate/) materials. The lesson materials were adapted so it could be taught in one half day.
* WEHIDay4 - [WEHI](https://www.wehi.edu.au/) ran its first Introduction to R workshop in 2018. The course was designed and lead by [Brendan Ansell](https://github.com/bansell). The entire course was taught over 4 x half days and I taught the last workshop. The lesson plan was designed by Brendan and I just added my own notes.
